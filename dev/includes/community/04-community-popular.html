                            This 6-hour tour begins from Kathmandu and takes its
                            first sightseeing intermission at a legendary town,
                            Bhaktapur. The highlights of this protected medieval
                            city are traditional pottery, wood carving,
                            beautiful temples, ponds and old traditional wooden
                            houses. The tour continues to Panauti, a small
                            village surrounded by green hills and holy rivers,
                            that embodies the spirit of an ancient Newari
                            community. While UNESCO world heritage site
                            Bhaktapur showcases the best of Newari architectural
                            skills, Panauti offers travellers an authentic
                            experience of Newari hospitality and an opportunity
                            to enjoy a local home-cooked meal.
