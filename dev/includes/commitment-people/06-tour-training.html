                                            I was with a guest who was in her 80s. We were at Pashupatinath temple where we were observing post death rituals and how
                                            Hindus bid farewell to a departed soul for the last time. My guest got emotional
                                            and expressed that these rituals reminded her of losing her husband whom she
                                            missed dearly. She told me that life is beautiful and that we must cherish what
                                            we have. Traveling made her feel alive and being at the temple that day helped
                                            her let go of her emotions. I remember that day because it made me feel a special
                                            human connection that transcends cultures and nationalities.

                                            turned out to be a good lesson that I carry with me. I also enjoyed playing different
