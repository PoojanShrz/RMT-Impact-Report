                                            Favorite memory from a trip

                                        <p class=" mb-3">
                                            I have had lots of good memories while leading a trip but the one that I recall instantly is during one of my Annapurna trips
                                            when I was leading a group of 8 people. Throughout the trip, there were several
                                            incidents that took place as we walked from Ghandruk to Landruk that weren’t
                                            necessarily good but the way they happened gave us something to laugh and talk
                                            about. It was a rainy day, making the trails slippery and infested with leeches.
                                            All of us were struggling to get downhill and had nasty leech bites. Somehow
                                            we kept moving with the help of our porters and our assistant guide. Although
                                            everyone was strictly instructed to not take pictures while walking and to watch
                                            our steps, a young woman was taking a video. She missed a step and tumbled down
                                            a cliff. Luckily, we had almost reached the base so the steepness was not dangerous.
                                            As our assistant guide went to help her, she jumped on him and both of them started
                                            rolling down the cliff further. Others started laughing but were also scared
                                            at the same time. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries and all of us made
                                            it to our destination.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="mb-3">
                                            As we settled down and talked about the day, our stomachs started cramping because of laughing too much. What had happened
                                            could have been serious but at the end of the day it brought about lots of laughter
                                            considering how the events unfolded, making the trip memorable.
